# `commands:gist`

This extension for the "Friends of WP Developer CLI" introduces the possibility to run predefined commands on the command line that are stored on gist (by GitHub). 

## Ideas

- Add GitHub users to the list
- store a hash of the command and check if it changed
- introduce parameter that allows to run command without asking [y/n]
